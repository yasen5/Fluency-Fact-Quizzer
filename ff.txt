Who
Mainly Spaniards initiated, affected Native Americans but also the Old World due to the plants brought back and the new fertile land being used to supply those crops.
Why
Arrival of spaniards and other explorers seeking wealth. 
What
Spaniards and other European explorers transferred deadly diseases to Native Americans which decimated their populations. They also brought domesticated animals like horses which, alongside new metal tools, revolutionized many Native Americans' ways of life. On the other side of the exchange, Europeans got new crops like the potato and tobacco for nutrition and recreation respectively. 
Where
Americas, Europe, China, Africa
When
1492-1500s
Significance
New crops greatly increased life expectancy of the average European, and new lands to farm flooded the market with crops like sugar. Disease decimated the Native population, and animals and meat changed the Native way of life

Encomienda System
Who
Spaniards (conquistadors granted encomenderos), Native Americans in Spanish-controlled territories (Mexico, American SW), Bartolomé de las Casas
Why
Exploitation of Native labor for profit. Spain also wanted more Spanish citizens in the Americas since they didn't have very good incentives for people to emigrate from Spain to the New World
What
Conquistadors granted encomiendas by the Crown, given rights to the labor of the indigenous people on that land (without their consent). In return Spanish were supposed to provide protection from other tribes, and convert indigenous people to Spanish culture and Catholicism. Limited in 1542 by the New Laws, which were supposed to free the indigenous people from enslavement and shift over to Africans. It also allowed indigenous people to settle internal disputes using their native customs, and they were granted protectors in court who could use Native traditions that didn't conflict with Catholicism.
Where
American SW (esp. New Mexico), Western coast of South America
When
1512-1720 (limited in 1542)
Significance
Led many Native Americans to die from disease (exposure to Europeans) and overworking. Led to resentment of Europeans and violent rebellions. Instilled ideas of race-based hierarchies that persisted after the collapse of the encomiendas.

Virginia Company
Who
London investors, explorers
Why
Money
What
Joint stock company formed to establish Jamestown colony. Sent 10,000 colonists, 80% die. Settlers landed during winter and couldn't grow crops, had a bad makeup of poor people and rich elites, neither of which knew how to farm. Survived only with the help of the Wampanoags under chief Massasoit, who taught them how to fish and plant the corn. Eventually they got their act together but the soil still wasn't good enough for pure subsistence agriculture, so they shifted to growing tobacco which was very profitable. Eventually they shifted to sugar when that became even more profitable. Created self-governing body of the House of Burgesses, where planter elites could vote on things in the Lower House (which sometimes conflicted with the Crown-appointed governor once the company went bankrupt and it became a royal colony).
Where
Jamestown, Virginia
When
1607

Pueblo Revolt
Who
Pueblo peoples in New Mexico (American SW), leader is Popé (Native American holy man), rebelled against Spanish settlers and priests
Why
Oppression of indigenous practices, bad working conditions, drought, attacks from other tribes
What
Due to oppression of indigenous practices (Franciscan Catholic priests didn't tolerate the survival of any part of Native culture) and execution/whipping of indigenous Holy people, resentment against Spaniards grew. When a drought year came in combination with raids from the Apache, this was enough to incite rebellion. Popé, one of those whipped by the Spanish governor, distributed knots which counted down the days until rebellion. The rebellion happened all over the Spanish colonies in New Mexico and 2k settlers were driven out, 20 priests killed. Eventually the Spanish return but are more tolerant of Native practices and dial back on the cruelties inflicted on Native Americans
Where
New Mexico / American SW
When
1680
Significance

King Philip's (Metacom's) War
Who
Metacom, Wampanoags, New England settlers

When
1675-1676
Significance
40% of Native Americans dead, 5% of colonists dead. Effectively destroyed any chance of successful resistance. Created distrust between settlers and Native Americans, further exacerbated by a lot of broken treaties in the future.

Salutary Neglect
Who
British, Colonists
Why
Britain wanted to keep the colonists happy, and so "subsidized" them by not collecting many taxes
What
The British tax collectors sometimes turned a blind eye to smuggling goods from other countries (goes against mercantilism) and allowed some tax evasion. This practice stopped after the conclusion of the French & Indian War, when Britain needed the money.
Where
North American Colonies
When
1700-1763
Significance
Colonists got used to evading British mercantilism and generally running their own tax programs, so resistance was fierce when the British actually tried enforcing direct taxes.

Why
Reaction against the decrease in religiousness following the scientific approaches introduced by the Enlightenment
What
Religious movement that emphasized the emotional aspects of religion. New denominations like Presbyterianism, etc. were formed

French & Indian War
Who
British Colonists (esp. Northern), French in Canada and West of British Colonies Native Americans on both sides
Why
British colonists wanted land (Ohio River Valley) held by French settlers to the West, there were often skirmishes.
What
George Washington saw some French soldiers and shot at them, war starts around then. Native Americans chose sides, so the Huron allied with the French and the Iroquois allied with the British (not just these tribes though). The French started off winning but the British were able to overcome them by going into debt to fund the war in America (directed by William Pitt). There was a larger battle going on in Europe which continued after the conclusion of this war.
Where
North America
When
1754-1763
Significance
Colonists realize that Britain isn't invincible. The loss of Salutary Neglect and introduction of taxes due to British war debt lead to the revolution. Florida given to U.S., France gave Louisiana to Spain. Native Americans lost the ability to play Europeans off of each other for advantage.

Plan of Union
Who
Ben Franklin, Albany Congress representatives
Why
French and Indian War, Franklin afraid of colonies getting picked at individually because of a lack of coordination.
What
Ben Franklin wanted the colonies to unite under a central colonial government to coordinate defense and trade. Both the colonies and the British government disliked the plan. Colonial governments feared losing their autonomy and power, and the British were afraid the colonists would get too much power?
Where
Albany, NY
When
1754
Significance
Showed diverse interests, sectionalism. The colonies weren’t yet ready to unify. Impact of the French and Indian War

Where
Great Lakes region
When
1763
Significance
Shows the difference between French and English treatment of NAI. Led to the Proclamation of 1763. NAI lost agency, but this was an example of the viability of NAI alliances against Europeans. Contributed to deteriorating relations with Britain and the Colonies. Led to the formation of the Paxton Boys

Stamp Act
Who
British Parliament, English Colonists, Sons of Liberty
Why
Britain in debt from 7 Years War
What
Required a tax stamp on all paper documents like newspapers and legal documents. This impacted all the colonists, not just the elites.
Where

1765
Significance
Colonists believe unconstitutional -> "No taxation without representation." Colonists petition the King, Stamp Act Congress forms in 1765. Formation of the Sons of Liberty. Repealed in 1766 due to protests and boycotts. Results in Declaratory Act, saying that Parliament can make any law they want.

Sons and Daughters of Liberty
Who
American colonists, Samuel Adams?
Why
They were angry about taxation without consent
What
The Sons of Liberty used threats, protests, and acts of violence (like the Boston Tea Party) to intimidate Loyalists and make their grievances clear to the British. The Daughters of Liberty supported boycotts, produced homemade products
Where

Significance
Incited feelings of anger in the colonies

Intolerable Acts
Who
Parliament, colonists
Why
A response to the Boston Tea Party
What
Acts like the quartering act (soldiers could stay in civilian homes), admin of justice act (British in Massachusetts couldn’t be tried in Massachusetts, had to be in other colony or even GB), limiting Massachusett’s self-government, closing the Boston port
Where
Colonies
When
1774
Significance
To punish the colonies, especially Boston and Massachusetts, for things like the Boston Tea Party. This confirmed to the colonies that the government just wanted to subjugate and subdue them

Republican Motherhood
Who
Abigail Adams, middle class, upper class white women
Why
To support the new democracy, inspired by Enlightenment philosophy (Wollstonecraft and Locke in particular)
What
New role prescribed for women to teach their sons the responsibilities of being in a democracy. Thus women had to become educated. Not as enlightened as Wollstonecraft's ideas, still rooted in patriarchy. Appealed to middle and upper class white women. 
Where
Mostly in New England states
When
1770s-1830s
Significance
Opened the door to education a little bit, allowed women to organize and start advocating, but separate spheres for men and women

Articles of Confederation
Who
12 delegates from American colonies
Why
Wanted to establish a federal government to tie the colonies together, but many state delegates were afraid of another British Crown situation and so made the government too weak to be effective.
What
New federal government couldn't impose taxes, couldn't hold an army because of that lack of taxation, couldn't regulate trade (led to fighting between states). Can't enforce its own laws (Shays' Rebellion). Needed 9 of 13 representatives to enact laws, 13/13 needed to amend laws. No court system, no executive branch. Basically like a weaker European Union. No President, no federal court system, had a congress though with one representative per state.
Effective with expansion: 
NW Ordinance
Could declare war
Could sing treaties, did the Treaty of Paris
Could deliver mail, coin money, trade with NAI
Where
American Colonies
When
1777-1789
Significance
Made the delegates realize that a stronger federal government would be required to effectively rule the colonies

NorthWest Ordinance of 1787
Who
Congress
Why
The colonists wanted to expand into the land they had won from the Revolutionary War
What
Declared that new territories would be added with the same rights as the other states. Banned slavery in the new territories. 
Where
Northwest territories (now Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Indiana)
When
1787
Significance
This was the biggest success of the Articles of Confederation. It gave equal rights to the new states and formalized/organized the process of adding new states

Shays' Rebellion
Who
Daniel Shays, poor massachusetts farmer, served in the Revolution (Bunker Hill, Saratoga), honored by Marquis de Lafayette
Why
During the war, the state went into debt, there was little paper money and very little specie, barter economy developed, state governments teetering on bankruptcy, they choose to do taxes to make up debt. Many people who fought in the war were taken to debtors prison. Could lose land, which was a decline in status because you needed land to vote. Wave of farm bankruptcies in Massachusetts. Most political officials in Massachusetts were in East Massachusetts and were relatively affluent traders who ignored these problems.
What
Had been tradition to do demonstrations when peoples' rights were violated. Delegations were held to see what demands they could make of the establishment, the government ignored them. They made lists of grievances about high salary of governor, high court costs, taxes. Shays' Rebellion wasn't a big surprise when it happened. 700 unpaid veterans close down courts, numbers grow to 1200. They demand:
Calling for printing of more $
They want judges to be elected not appointed (so that judges can be more answerable to the people so they can't put debtors in jail)
Broke into jails and released debtors.
Federal government is powerless
State militia is called up funded by Bostononian businessmen to respond to rebellion, they succeed, Shays flees and many sentenced to death, Samuel Adams wanted mass executions, GW and John Hancock wanted leniency. Last minute pardons for most, only 2 were hanged for looting.
Where
Massachusetts
When
1787
Significance
Hancock passed moratorium on debt, taxes but they were short lived. Fed government couldn't regulate trade which made trade across states really bad (currency exchanges, tariffs) nobody working together as one unit.

Great Compromise
Who
Congress, small states vs. big states, Madison, Sherman
Why
Small states and big states both want as many votes as possible. Small states wanted everyone to have equal representation, fear of being a minority dominated by the majority. Larger states feel that votes should be based purely on population. Really need all the states to agree on this to get the Constitution ratified.
What
Two main plans proposed Eventually a plan is accepted where there is one House of Representatives based on population, and there is a Senate where all states get 2 senators. 
Where
Philadelphia
When
1787
Significance
One of the many compromises that needed to be made in order to get the Constitution ratified. Balances the power of big and small states, shows the ability of the states to compromise

Federalist Papers
Who
John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison (before he became less Federalist)
Why
To convince New York that stronger government is necessary to hold the nation together and create a functioning republic. This would give them the one extra vote they need to get the Constitution passed and grant more powers to the federal government.
What
Papers written by these 3 under the pseudonym of Publius. Famous ones are:
#10 - Argues that having a larger republic means that factionalism won't occur as easily, because candidates can't appeal to only one region
#51 - Discusses the importance of checks and balances
Where
U.S.
When
1788
Significance
Addressed fears about the constitution and balance of power. They became an important guide for interpreting the Constitution through understanding the intent

What
Great Britain agreed to withdraw from the Northwest territory, to pay the Americans for the ships they had impressed into their military, and allow limited trading in the Caribbean. The Americans paid their pre-war debts. Britain also got “most favored nation” status. This was opposed by JDRs
Where
US
When
1794
Significance
Passed by a very slim margin. Required the passage of the Pinckney Treaty to appease the Jeffersonians. Leads to the XYZ affair

Washington’s Farewell Address
Who
George Washington
Why
Warn the nation to watch out for threats to democracy as GW left office due to health issues and the stress of presidency.
What
Letter written by GW at the end of his second term. It encouraged the preservation of the union, trade with foreign countries, and discouraged against factions and permanent alliances.
Where
US
When
1796

XYZ Affair
Who
John Adams, American and French diplomats
Why
Caused by Jay’s Treaty
What
American peace delegation wanted to meet French delegates (X, Y, and Z in Adams’ initial communication with Congress) but they demanded $250k just in order to open negotiations, so the Americans refused.
Where
United States, France
When
1797-1798
Significance
Resulted in the Quasi War. Raised Anti-French sentiment, resulting in the Alien and Sedition Acts and the establishment of the Department of the Navy to oversee naval affairs


Alien and Sedition Acts
Who
John Adams, Congress, Thomas Jefferson
Why
There was outcry against Adams and the Federalists
What
An act that repressed freedom of the press, jailed newspaper editors, and created harsher requirements for immigrants to become citizens. The goal was to minimize the JDR’s power. It was removed
Where
US
When
1798-1801
Significance
Violated 1st Amendment but the Federalist party controlled executive and legislative branches, and there was no judicial review so the judicial branch didn’t have all that much power. Led to experimentation with the compact theory and nullification as a response.

Second Great Awakening
Who
Charles Finney, Peter Cartwright, Richard Allen
Why
People wanted religion + society was becoming more connected, people felt responsible for improving the moral standard of their whole society
What
Religious revival starting in NY, spread south to slaves and white southerners. Rejection of Calvinism, increasing in Baptist & Methodist churches. Women allowed to participate more fully than in 1st GA. Slaves attend same religious occasions as Whites, message of emancipation. Free Blacks like Richard Allen from Philadelphia set up churches.
Where
Started in Burned Over District, spread south and west.
When
1790s-1830s
Significance
Emphasis on individual piety like the first Great Awakening, moral responsibility to improve society. Increased literacy, esp in South where religion hadn't been the primary motivation for immigration so they hadn't educated kids to read the bible. Created atmosphere for reform: Temperance, improved Asylums, Education, Utopias, Women's Movements, Abolition. Churches founded in the Northeast by free Blacks were centers of education and medicine that were denied by Whites.

Market Revolution
Who
Entrepreneurs, Lowell, Slater
Why
Spread of the Industrial Revolution
What
Rapid development in transportation, commercialization, and industrialization. Includes development of factory system, interchangeable parts, employees working by the clock. Women more common in the workplace, but under exploitative pay and conditions.
Where

Significance
Industrial regionalization (North vs South), shift towards paid labor, factory work. More opportunity for women in industrial workforce

Marbury v Madison
Who
Marbury, John Adams, James Madison, John Marshall
Why
To establish judicial review, power of federal courts to void acts of Congress in conflict with Constitution (Judicial branch still cannot enforce them, that's the role of the president). To give the judicial branch more power without angering Jefferson
What
Midnight judges granted by John Adams under Judiciary Act of congress that gives him the authority to appoint the federal judges. Madison is secretary of state and stalls the judgeships. Marbury sues, says that he is owed the job, but John Marshall decides to say that the Judiciary Act was unconstitutional (even though he was a federalist, he won the larger battle in giving the judiciary branch more power).
Where
US
When
1803 (Marshall Court)
Significance
Established role of the Supreme Court. Judicial review courts have a duty to say if laws are constitutional or not but not to enforce them


American System
Who
Henry Clay
Why
To make America less reliant on foreign made goods (reliance shown by Embargo, War of 1812)
What
His 3 point plan was to renew the national bank, establish tariffs, and have the federal government finance roads and canals. The last part got vetoed but the others passed. He wanted to make America less reliant on foreign goods
Where
US
When
1816-1830
Significance
Government sponsored the development of the economy by protecting new industries and reducing dependence on foreign-made goods. It was important for infrastructure. Increased sectionalism (the North and West benefited more). Furthered the ideas of Hamilton’s Economic Plan


Missouri Compromise
Who
Slave states, Free states, Henry Clay
Why
States wanted to expand to the West. States wanted to have a secure balance of slave/free states, otherwise thought that one side would dominate the other, North wanted slavery to end but also thought South would secede in this situation.
What
Missouri was added as a slave state, and to keep the balance of pro-/anti-slavery representatives in the Senate, Maine was added as a free state. They also established the Missouri compromise line (36’30), where states below the line would be slave states and states above the line (with the exception of Missouri) would be free states
Where
United States, Missouri, Maine, 36’30 line
When
1820
Significance
The Senate remained balanced between slave and free states. No solution was made to end slavery, bringing more people to the abolition movement. Leads to more sectionalism

Monroe Doctrine
Who
John Quincy Adams, James Monroe
Why
Spanish and Russians were trying to take more control in the Americas
What
Statement issued saying that Western Hemisphere was closed to European intervention and colonization in return for the US staying out of European affairs
Where
US
When

Significance
They could not enforce it, so Britain’s navy had to enforce it. It wasn’t utilized for decades, but showed the US participating in global affairs


Second American Party System
Who
Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, Democrat Party, Whig Party
Why
Many people didn’t like Jackson’s anti-spending policies and supported Henry Clay’s American System
What
The party system during the Jacksonian era. Lines were drawn between anti-bank Jacksonians and pro-American System Whigs. There was high voter interest and very close elections
Where
United States
When
1828-1854
Significance
Shaped political, social, and cultural attitudes during the era of Jacksonian Democracy. Represented a change in party politics (use of conventions, having the executive as the head of the party, universal suffrage for white men, spoils system)

Indian Removal Act
Who
AJ, Congress, Marshall Court, Southern Civilized Tribes
Why
Andrew Jackson was for the "common man," many whites wanted to move westward into Native American territory, either looking for more freedom or trying to find more farmable land (after they destroyed the soil with tobacco/cotton). Racism against Native Americans, viewed them as uncivilized, even those who had assimilated and switched purely to agriculture and manufacture. 
What
Several Cherokee members agree to the Treaty of New Echota, payment in exchange for moving west. Other members including Chief John Ross strongly oppose this decision but US Gov ignores their protests. All 5 Civilized Tribes (Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, Creek) forced west over time, because even though Judicial Review determined that states could not force eviction of the Cherokee because they were a sovereign nation, Jackson refused to enforce this decision. The army was sent in, and all of the tribes were forced to go on the Trail of Tears, with many dying along the way.
Where
George, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida → Oklahoma
When
1830
Significance
Continued the trend since the arrival of white settlers of Native Americans being pushed off of their land. Exemplified the Democrats' strong desire for westward expansion. Seminole resistance in Florida managed to stave off settlers until 1842, one of the last examples of successful Native American resistance.

Nat Turner’s Rebellion
Who
Nat Turner
Why
Slavery?
What
Armed rebellion, killed 57 white people, including children, as retribution for slavery
Where
Virginia
When

Nullification Crisis
Who
Andrew Jackson, South Carolina, John C. Calhoun
Why
Previous experiment in nullification with the Kentucky & Virginia Resolutions, right of state to nullify federal laws, but the supreme court rules against this idea. Sectional crisis:
Power of the Fed Gov't vs state gov't
Economic needs of different regions (North wants tariffs, South doesn't)
South getting consistently outvoted by the North & West
Debate over role of government in the economy
Political power in Congress
Major Sectional Leaders: Daniel Webster for North, John C Calhoun for South, Henry Clay for West
South Carolina struggling economically for 15 years
What
John C. Calhoun wants to assert sovereignty of South Carolina, go against Tariffs, tries to convince Jackson. Jackson refuses because it would threaten his power, dismisses Calhoun.
SC calls up militia and threatens to secede from the Union if Jackson used force
Jackson uses Force Bill from Congress, authorizes Federal government to collect tariff with military)
Clay does the Tariff Act of 1833 as compromise, says that each year the tariff will lower, South Carolina backs down
Where
US
When
1832-1833
Significance
Foreshadows sectionalism, could have been the civil war starting point if not for Clay's intervention, Jackson defending his presidential power


Bank War
Who
Andrew Jackson, Nicholas Biddle, Henry Clay
Why
Andrew Jackson wanted to maintain his power, disliked powerful Northern  bankers having influence (he liked to appeal to the "common man" against the elites) (Farmers tend to owe money to banks due to boom/bust cycles, don't trust them), believed it wasn't strictly constitutional, undemocratic (Bank leaders not elected)
What
AJ vetoed the renewal of the national bank. Biddle tries to prove the worth of the national bank by being more mean, just backfires and makes Jackson look correct 
Where
United States
When
1832
Significance
Andrew Jackson asserting his power with vetoes. No more national bank until 1913, U.S. on much shakier grounds.


Seneca Falls Convention
Who
Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton
Why
Women's rights were severely limited: they lost all of their property when they married and they were denied the right to vote.
What
Made the Declaration of Sentiments, modeled after the declaration of independence, pointed out the many rights denied to women. Some were skeptical of pushing for suffrage, but Frederick Douglass convinced them that it was the best way to push for further rights.
Where
Seneca Falls, NY
When
1848
Significance
Kicked off the women's rights movement. Part of larger atmosphere of reform, part response to market revolution (women accepted into workplace, need more protection from exploitative conditions, want to be able to manage their own income), part response to 2nd Great Awakening (ideas of reforming society). 

Manifest Destiny
Who
American settlers, Native Americans, Mexicans
Why
To gain more arable land for growing cash crops like tobacco and cotton, and expand slavery after the Missouri Compromise made it difficult for Southern states to get more land.
What
Many people expressed their belief that Whites deserved to dominate the North American continent, whether through demonstrating superiority in their economy and way of life, or through violent conquest.
Where
California, Utah, New Mexico, Texas
When
1845-1900
Significance
Set up the U.S. to be economically powerful with railroads connecting the East and West and U.S. ports existing on both coasts

Mexican-American War
Who
Santa Anna, Zachary Taylor, James Polk, Irish & German immigrants, Mexicans
Why
Manifest Destiny Same as Manifest Destiny
What
Zachary Taylor, at command of James Polk, incites conflict with Mexico. U.S. goes to war, heavy casualties due to disease, desertion rampant (esp. among immigrants, saw the horrors and left or even switched sides). Many accusations of unjust war, but even antiwar Whigs don't oppose it strongly enough to stop voting to continue it. Americans commit atrocities, shell civilians and commit sexual violence, eventually capture Mexico City and force the sale of California, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Arizona
Where
New Mexico, California, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Mexico City
When
1846-1848

Compromise of 1850
Who
Henry Clay
Why
Preservation of the Union over the issue of slavery
What
Five things:
California admitted as free state
Utah, New Mexico given popular sovereignty for slavery (North not too       concerned, land isn't great for farming anyway
Texas got $10M to give up its land claims in New Mexico
Fugitive slave act, allowed federal agents to forcibly relocate African Americans suspected of being escaped slaves
Slave trade ended in Washington D.C., slavery itself persists
Where
U.S.
When
1850
Significance
Last attempt made at real compromise, pure downhill from here. Fugitive slave act a big mistake, put the brutality of slavery in the minds of even moderate Northerners and turned them abolitionist once people started getting dragged through the streets. Also made the Northerners dissatisfied with the government, believed it was too sympathetic to slavery

Kansas-Nebraska Act
Who
Stephen Douglas, John Calhoun, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster
Why
Stephen Douglas wanted to build some railroad that out west that would link his property holdings to strong transportation infrastructure. Needed population in the Western territories to get this to happen, needed an event that would cause people to rush in.
What
Douglas somehow managed to get this through, it violated the Missouri Compromise because it allowed two more slave states in territory above the 36th parallel. Unlike NM and Utah these areas were actually good for farming, so there was the perceived threat of slavery. People rushed in and things even got violent in Bleeding Kansas. Both states admitted as free anyway because the pro-slavery constitution for Kansas was rejected.
Where
Kansas, Nebraska

He also stated that enslaved people were property and thus the constitution barred any state from banning it (Missouri Compromise struck down).
Where
Supreme Court
When
1857
Significance
One of the major reasons why the civil war occurred, major distrust between factions that each thought the other was taking over the government, abolitionists thought that if Southern slaveowners weren't stopped then and there, their influence would spread throughout the government

Emancipation Proclamation
Who
Lincoln, Confederate States
Why
To get African American soldiers in the army, make the war about slavery so that European countries couldn't ally with Confederates even though they depended on Southern cotton.
What
Happened following the Battle of Antietam (1862) which gave Lincoln a breather after the string of Union losses to issue his proclamation. Stated that all slaves in the Southern territories were property of people in rebellion and thus could be confiscated and freed. Didn't free anyone immediately, also held no promises for emancipation in the 4 border states that held slaves but weren't in rebellion, Lincoln didn't feel like he had the constitutional right to take property from people he wasn't at war with.
Where
U.S.
When

Much of the land fell to land speculators and railroad companies.
Where
West
